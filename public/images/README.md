# Contestant Images

Place your PNG images for each contestant in this folder with the following names:

- `jom.png` - Image for Jom
- `ten.png` - Image for Ten
- `gino.png` - Image for Gino
- `pao.png` - Image for Pao

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency support)
- **Recommended size**: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for best performance

## How to Add Images

1. Prepare your PNG images for each contestant
2. Name them exactly as shown above (lowercase, matching the contestant IDs)
3. Place them in this `public/images/` folder
4. The images will automatically appear on the website

## Fallback

If an image is missing, the browser will show a broken image icon. Make sure all four images are present:

- jom.png
- ten.png
- gino.png
- pao.png
